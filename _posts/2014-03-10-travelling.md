I came to the US in August 2012 for pursuing my masters in Computer Science at
USC. Since then, when not studying and working on my assignments I travelled.
I am writing this post because I want to tell a story and will do so using the
pictures which I clicked while I travelled.

###I live in Los Angeles. So went and saw the Hollywood sign up-close.
